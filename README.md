# Honda Internship Projects – Structural Analysis & Logistics Optimization  
**Part Logistic and Control (PLC) Department | Summer 2025**
This repository highlights selected projects from my 7-week internship at **Honda Cars India Ltd.**, where I worked in the **Part Logistic and Control (PLC)** department. My focus was on structural assessments and optimization initiatives in a dynamic industrial environment.

A brief summary of all projects and contributions can be found in the [Internship Report](./Internship Report.pdf)

## Documented Projects
### 1. Rim Pallet Structural Assessment
Evaluated the structural stability and safety of stacked rim pallets in the logistics workflow. Identified deformation and load-related risks, and proposed retrofit designs to enhance safety and consistency.
